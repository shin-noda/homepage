name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow runs whenever you push code to the 'main' branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Only run on pushes to main

permissions:
  contents: write  # Give GitHub Actions permission to push

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu environment

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get a copy of your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        # This pulls your code from GitHub so the workflow can work with it

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20  # Install Node.js version 20
        # Node.js is needed to run npm commands like 'install' and 'build'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        # 'npm ci' installs all dependencies exactly as listed in package-lock.json
        # It's cleaner and more reliable than 'npm install' for CI/CD

      # Step 4: Build the project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
        # This runs your build script
        # In your package.json, predeploy already runs 'vite build' which generates the 'dist' folder

      # Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
        # This action takes your 'dist' folder and pushes it to the 'gh-pages' branch
        # GitHub Pages then serves the site from that branch
        # The github_token is automatically provided by GitHub; no need to create your own token
